# PCDH19_SWA_computationalmodel
 
Model created at the OIST Computational Neuroscience Course 2018 with a lot of help from my tutor: Dr. Espen Hagen.


The model was created using the PyNEST simulator (Gewaltig et al. 2007)

The model was incorporated exactly as described by Destexhe 2009.

LFP output of the model was simulated based on an adaptation of Mazzoni et al. 2015.
